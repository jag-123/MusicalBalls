# MusicalBalls
Final project for MUS277

*insert pic here*

Using a Logitech C270 Widescreen HD Webcam to look at a tray of balls, a python 3.7 script sends messages to a Max 8 patch on the order and colors of the balls in the tray. Each colored ball represents a unique sound and pressing a FSR sensor determines how long each sound is played. The IR sensor determines volume but if it is not being used, it defaults to half volume.
